# 1. Python Project Night - Hands-on problem solving with Python for PyRVA

Welcome to the Python Project Night organized by PyRVA. Here you will find the Python challange problems and projects that we will solve together as a group.

## 1.1 Challange Problems
Challenge problems are fun, hands-on coding exercises covering a variety of topics. The participants of Project Night are assigned to teams of four, and then solve the problem together in an hour. Teams are designed to have diverse experience levels, giving team members equal opportunity to learn and share ideas.

### 1.1.1 What you need
- Wi-fi, laptop, power chord
- Python 3
- Editor: Any
- OS: GNU/Linux. OS X, Windows

## 1.2 Projects
### 1.2.1 Data Analysis With Pandas
Pandas is the defacto package for data analysis in Python, it provides high-performance and easy-to-use data structures. In this project, we are going to use the basics of pandas to analyze Google Play Store data. What can we learn about trends in the Google Play Store and what stories can we tell with the data? Teams are designed the same way as challange problems.
